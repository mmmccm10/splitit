# Onboarding sheet — SplitIt

Answer in this file, inside your project folder. Use the AI as much as you like — then verify every answer in the code or by clicking. Write *where* you verified (file + line, or what you clicked).

## Ask the code

1. In one sentence, what does SplitIt do for its user?
2. Which file runs first when you start the app? How do you know?
3. Where is the data stored? Name the file and the three tables.
4. Click **Add expense**. Which function runs? Which function does *that* call to save it?
5. `get_group_members` is used in more than one place. Where? Why is it a function instead of copy-pasting the code?
6. Add an expense with amount `0` and one with `-20`. What happens? Find the line that should have stopped you.

## Verify the AI

7. Ask the AI: *"What happens to the balances when I delete a member who paid for an expense?"* Then do it. Was the AI right? Paste its answer and what actually happened.
8. Ask the AI to explain `compute_balances`. Find one thing it glossed over or got wrong.
9. **Bug #1** — `issues/001-wrong-balance.md`: *"Balances are off by one share whenever the person who paid is also in the split."* Reproduce it with a 3-person group and a €30 dinner. Name the line. Fix it. Save the file and check the app shows the right result now.
10. Three questions you'd ask the developer who left.
